# Tanuki

An open-source, Compose Multiplatform (Android + iOS) client for GitLab — think
"GitHub Mobile, but for GitLab". Browse your projects, review merge requests, and act on
them from your phone. Community-driven and MIT-licensed.

## Vision

A polished, general-purpose GitLab client that works for **anyone** on gitlab.com (with
self-hosted instances on the roadmap), not a single-company tool. Contributions welcome.

## Features

- **OAuth 2.0 + PKCE login** through the system browser — 2FA and SSO handled by GitLab's web login.
- **Projects browser** — list, search, and filter (All / Starred / Personal / Shared) with star counts.
- **Project dashboard** — merge requests, code, tags, releases, pipelines, branches, and an activity pulse.
- **Merge requests** — review-requested & assigned queues; a rich detail view with reviewers + approval
  status, additions/deletions/files stats, and tabs for Overview / Commits / Pipelines / Changes.
- **Diff viewer** — horizontally-scrollable code with line-level comments (view, reply, resolve).
- **Deep links** — shared `gitlab.com/…/-/merge_requests/N` links open straight to the MR (Android).
- **Dark & light themes** — follows the system setting.

## Status

Both platforms **build and run on device** today (Android phones and iPhone). The v1 surface —
OAuth login, projects browser, and merge-request review — is implemented.

**Backlog:** issues, full repository/code browser, richer pipelines/CI, to-dos, self-hosted
instances, snippets, and iOS distribution via Firebase.

## Auth model

Login uses **OAuth 2.0 with PKCE** through the system browser (Chrome Custom Tabs on
Android, `ASWebAuthenticationSession` on iOS). This means **2FA and SSO are handled by
GitLab's own web login for free** — the app never sees a password or OTP. This is the same
approach GitHub Mobile uses and the only robust way to support 2FA, since GitLab disables
password-based API grants when 2FA is enabled.

The data layer is built around a configurable instance URL, so self-hosted GitLab support
(via per-instance OAuth apps or Personal Access Tokens) can be added without rework.

## Getting it running locally

1. Register an OAuth application on gitlab.com
   (https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/applications): **uncheck "Confidential"** (public
   PKCE client), redirect URI `dev.tanuki://oauth-callback`, scope `api`.
2. Paste the Application ID into `core/data/.../network/GitLabConfig.kt` (`CLIENT_ID`).
3. Android: open in Android Studio or `./gradlew :composeApp:installDebug`.
   iOS: open `iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj`, set your signing Team in
   `iosApp/Configuration/Config.xcconfig`, and run.

## Architecture

Kotlin Multiplatform, feature-layered clean architecture. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Versioning

Tanuki follows [SemVer](https://semver.org). The current version is **0.1.0**.

`versionName` / `versionCode` default from `gradle.properties` (`tanuki.versionName`,
`tanuki.versionCode`) and are overridden in CI from the release tag:

```bash
./gradlew :composeApp:assembleRelease -Ptanuki.versionName=0.1.0 -Ptanuki.versionCode=42
```

## Releases & internal distribution

Distribution to internal testers runs through **Firebase App Distribution**, driven by
release tags. Pushing a SemVer tag builds and ships automatically:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The [`distribute-android`](.github/workflows/distribute-android.yml) workflow then builds a
release APK (versioned from the tag) and uploads it to the `internal-testers` group. It can
also be triggered manually via **workflow_dispatch**.

**Required GitHub secrets:**

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `FIREBASE_APP_ID` | Firebase Android app id (`1:…:android:…`) |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | JSON key of a service account with the *Firebase App Distribution Admin* role |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | *(optional)* base64 of the release keystore — omit to debug-sign |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` / `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` / `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | *(optional)* keystore credentials |

Optional repo **variable** `FIREBASE_TESTER_GROUPS` overrides the default tester group.

> **iOS distribution** via Firebase is planned. iOS uses Ad Hoc distribution, which needs a
> paid Apple Developer account and each tester's device UDID registered in the provisioning
> profile (with a rebuild when new testers join) — so it's a follow-up.
